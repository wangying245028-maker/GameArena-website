            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>GameArena</strong>. By downloading, installing, or using the GameArena mobile application
                (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
            </p>
            <p>
                These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the GameArena development team ("we", "us", or "our").
                We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes take effect
                constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>GameArena provides the following core services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Game Generation:</strong> Users submit text prompts; our AI generates playable casual HTML5 games.</li>
                <li><strong>Arena Community:</strong> Users publish games to a public feed where others can play, like, and share.</li>
                <li><strong>PK Battles:</strong> Real-time or asynchronous challenges between players based on game performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Points Economy:</strong> An in-app points system that rewards creators and enables premium AI features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
                You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use GameArena. By using the App, you represent that
                you meet this minimum age requirement. Users under 18 should have parental or guardian consent.
            </p>

            <h2>4. User Accounts &amp; Device Identity</h2>
            <p>
                GameArena uses a <strong>Device ID</strong> to identify you. This allows you to use the App without
                a mandatory registration. By using the App, you acknowledge that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your progress, points, and published games are tied to your Device ID;</li>
                <li>Clearing app data, switching devices, or uninstalling the App may result in loss of locally stored data;</li>
                <li>We are not responsible for data loss due to device changes without account linking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Points System</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Earning Points</h3>
            <p>Points are awarded for activities such as publishing games, receiving likes, and winning PK battles.
            Specific earn rates are subject to change and are displayed within the App.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Spending Points</h3>
            <p>Points may be used to trigger AI game generation and unlock premium generation features.
            Spent points are non-refundable.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Purchased Points</h3>
            <p>Points purchased via in-app purchase are subject to the refund policies of the applicable app store
            (Apple App Store or Google Play). We do not directly offer cash refunds for purchased points.</p>

            <h3>5.4 No Cash Value</h3>
            <p>Points have <strong>no monetary value</strong> and cannot be exchanged for cash, transferred between accounts,
            or used outside of GameArena.</p>

            <h3>5.5 Abuse Prevention</h3>
            <div class="warn-box">
                Any attempt to artificially earn points through bots, scripts, exploits, or coordinated fake engagement
                will result in immediate account suspension and forfeiture of all points without refund.
            </div>

            <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>

            <h3>6.1 Your Content</h3>
            <p>You retain ownership of the text prompts you write. By publishing a game to the Arena,
            you grant GameArena a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display,
            and promote that game within the App and in marketing materials.</p>

            <h3>6.2 AI-Generated Games</h3>
            <p>
                The playable game code generated by our AI based on your prompt is provided for your personal,
                non-commercial use within GameArena. You may not extract, redistribute, or sell the generated
                game code as a standalone product.
            </p>

            <h3>6.3 Prohibited Content</h3>
            <div class="warn-box">
                <strong>You must not generate, publish, or share content that:</strong>
